# About
Designed to be as user friendly and simple as possible. This website has one job only - to help developers quickly and painlessly generate gradients, copy them, and use them in their own work. 

Built as a static site rendered in the browser using Vanilla JS and hosted on Netlify. 
This was a personal project built to scratch my own itch, and allowed me to practise client-side rendering and DOM manipulation, as well as LocalStorage, JSON parsing and manipulation.

# Notes
- Not intended for mobile (not responsive for smaller than tablet view)

# Ideas for extending:
- click-to-copy gradient string 
- don't allow user to bookmark the same gradient twice
- replace color picker with a better UI module like jscolor
- add option to increase number of colours / direction & type of gradient
- allow users to edit gradient string and dynamically change background in response.
- create back button to go back through LocalStorage array of past gradients.
